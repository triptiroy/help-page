      <div className="title"><h1>Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM)</h1></div>
      <p>Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM) are used for electro-mechanical energy conversions in many industries such as rolling mills, power plants, steel industries, locomotives, electric vehicles, etc.</p>
      <h1>Causes and Identification of Faults</h1>
      <h2 className="subheading">CAUSES</h2>
      <p className="content">
        The causes of the faults can be attributed mainly due to the hotspot formation and presence of the uneven magnetic pull. The hotspot formation and the presence of the uneven magnetic pull may result from insulation degradation, non-uniform loading patterns, installation defects, manufacturing defects, etc.
        </p>
      <h2 className="subheading">IDENTIFICATION</h2> 
      <p className="content">  
        Each fault of SCIM induces few fault frequency components in the armature current and the vibration signal spectrum. In most of the cases, those frequency components are used to identify the fault types.
      </p>
      <h1>Types of Faults</h1>
      <h2 className="subheading">Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) and Broken End Ring (BER) faults</h2>
      <p className="content">Single or multiple rotor bars or the end ring may break because of the uneven magnetic pull. The most likely locations of the breakage are the joints between the end ring and the rotor bars.</p>
      <img src={screenshot6} alt="Screenshot 6" style={{ width: '400px', height: '300px' }} />
      <p>The presence of Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) and Broken End Ring (BER) faults in traction motors induces specific fault frequencies in the armature current and vibration spectra. These fault frequencies are critical for diagnosing motor health.
         In the armature current spectrum, BRB faults induce frequency components expressed by: <br /><div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>brb1</sub> = (1 ± 2k<sub>1</sub>s)f<sub>s</sub>, k<sub>1</sub> = 1, 2, 3, ... </div><br />The negative sign components result directly from asymmetry, causing torque ripple, while positive sign components arise indirectly. <br />Additionally, BRB faults manifest as <br /><div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>brb2</sub> = [(k<sub>2</sub>/p)(1 − s) ± s]f<sub>s</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>/p = 1, 2, 3, ...</div> <br /> and <br /> <div className="highlight-box">f<sub>brb3</sub> = (7 − 8s)f<sub>s</sub></div> <br /> especially detectable under pulsating load conditions using space harmonic components.
         In the vibration spectrum, BRB and BER faults exhibit frequencies represented by<br /> <div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>v<sub>brb1</sub></sub> = f<sub>r</sub> ± kf<sub>p</sub>, k = 0, 1</div><br /> ​where f<sub>p</sub> = 2p<sub>p</sub>(f<sub>sync</sub> − f<sub>r</sub>), f<sub>sync</sub> = f<sub>s</sub>, f<sub>r</sub> denotes rotational frequency, and p<sub>p</sub> is the number of pole pairs. Notably, the power of the rotational frequency component increases during BRB or BER faults, making it distinguishable.<br /> Under light loading conditions, frequencies 
         <br /><div className="highlight-box">f<sub>v<sub>brb2</sub></sub> = f<sub>t</sub> ± 2kf<sub>s</sub></div><br /> and <br /> <div className="highlight-box">f<sub>t</sub> = f<sub>r</sub>N<sub>R</sub></div> <br /> are employed, with N<sub>R</sub> representing the number of rotor bars  and k = 1, 2, 3, ... .
         These fault frequencies play a crucial role in diagnosing BRB and BER faults, especially in traction motors, aiding in the maintenance and reliability of electrical systems.<br />

      <h2 className="subheading">Eccentricity faults</h2>
      <p className="content">In the presence of eccentricity fault, the air-gap between the rotor and stator of the SCIM does not remain uniform along the stator inner periphery. Eccentricity faults can be of three type, static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity</p>
      <img src={screenshot7} alt="Screenshot 7" style={{ width: '700px', height: '300px' }} />
      <h3 className='subheading2'>1. Static eccentricity:</h3>
      <p className="content">In the case of static eccentricity fault, the axis of rotation 
        and the rotor axis coincide with each other, but they are different from the stator 
        axis. The axis mismatch creates a non-uniform air-gap profile along the stator 
        inner periphery, but the profile does not change with the rotor rotation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 className='subheading2'>2. Dynamic eccentricity:</h3>
      <p className="content">In the case of dynamic eccentricity, the stator axis and 
        the axis of rotation coincide with each other, but they are different from the rotor 
        axis. Therefore, under the dynamic eccentricity condition, the minimum air-gap 
        location rotates with the rotation of the rotor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 className='subheading2'>3. Mixed eccentricity:</h3>
      <p className="content">Under all practical circumstances, the static and the dynamic eccentricities exist together for a machine, and such condition is called 
        mixed eccentricity. In the case of mixed eccentricity, all the three axes, stator 
        axis, rotor axis and the axis of rotation are different from each other.
      </p>

      <p className="content">The unbalance created in the magnetic and electric circuits of the SCIM due to the 
        eccentricity faults induces fault related frequency components in the armature current 
        and vibration signal spectrum. The fault frequencies appearing in the armature current 
        signal are as follows: <br /><div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>ecc1</sub> =[(kN<sub>R</sub> ± n<sub>d</sub>)((1 - s)/(p<sub>p</sub>)± v]f<sub>s</sub>,  k = 1, 2, 3, ··· and v = 1, 3, 5, ··· </div><br />
        where n<sub>d</sub> = 0 for the static eccentricity and n<sub>d</sub> = 1, 2, 3, ··· for the dynamic eccentricity.<br />
        <br />In the case of the mixed eccentricity, the following frequencies are also observed in the motor 
        current spectrum: <br />
        <div className="highlight-box">f<sub>ecc2</sub> = [(1 - s)/p<sub>p</sub>± k]fs, k = 1, 2, 3, ···</div><br />
        The following mixed eccentricity frequency components in the vibration signal spectrum 
        are used to detect eccentricity faults: <br/>
        <div className="highlight-box">f<sub>v<sub>ecc1</sub></sub> = f<sub>s</sub> |1 ± kf<sub>r</sub>| , k = 1, 2, 3, ···</div>
      </p>
      <h2 className="subheading">Bearing faults</h2>
      <p className="content">Bearing consists of three major parts: inner ring, outer ring and rolling elements. Rolling
        elements can have shapes like balls, cylinders, tapered cylinders, etc.</p>
      <img src={screenshot8} alt="Screenshot 8" style={{ width: '400px', height: '300px' }} />
      <p className="content">Due to fatigue, corrosion, improper lubrication,installation defects, etc., small parts of the bearings may break loose.<br />
      Depending on the location of the brokage, the bearing faults can be of three types, inner raceway,
      outer raceway and rolling element faults.<br />
      <img src={screenshot9} alt="Screenshot 9" style={{ width: '800px', height: '300px' }} /><br />
      The effect of the bearing faults is more prominent in the motor vibration signal than the armature current signal.The fault frequencies 
      observed in the motor vibration signal are as follows:<br />
      1. Inner raceway fault :<div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>v<sub>inner</sub></sub> = N<sub>b</sub>/2f<sub>r</sub>[1 + (b<sub>d</sub> (cos(β<sub>c</sub>))/d<sub>ρ</sub>]</div><br />
      2. Outer raceway fault :<div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>v<sub>outer</sub></sub> = N<sub>b</sub>/2f<sub>r</sub>[1 - (b<sub>d</sub> (cos(β<sub>c</sub>))/d<sub>ρ</sub>]</div><br />
      3. Rolling element fault :<div className="highlight-box"> f<sub>v<sub>rolling</sub></sub> = d<sub>ρ</sub>f<sub>r</sub>/b<sub>d</sub>[1 - (b<sub>d</sub> (cos(β<sub>c</sub>)/d<sub>ρ</sub>))<sup>2</sup>]</div><br />
      where N<sub>b</sub> is the number of rolling elements, b<sub>d</sub> is the rolling element diameter, d<sub>p</sub> is the
      pitch diameter and βc is the contact angle between the rolling element and the inner
      or outer raceway.<br />
      The vibration fault frequencies get reflected in the motor armature current spectrum as follows:<br />
      <div className="highlight-box">f<sub>bb</sub> = f<sub>s</sub> ± kf<sub>v</sub>, k = 1, 2, 3, ···</div><br />
      where f<sub>v</sub> is f<sub>v<sub>inner</sub></sub>, f<sub>v<sub>outer</sub></sub> or f<sub>v<sub>rolling</sub></sub>.

      <h1>A general SCIM fault detection framework</h1>
      <img src={screenshot10} alt="Screenshot 10" style={{ width: '500px', height: '400px' }} />
      <p>
      The necessary steps in any SCIM fault detection system are as follows:<br />
      <br /><strong>1. Signal measurement:</strong> Motor voltage, current, vibration, temperature, search coil 
      voltage, etc. are the standard signals used for SCIM fault detection. Depending 
      on the method, either one of them or a combination of those signals are used.<br />
      <br /><strong>2. Prefiltering and A/D conversion:</strong> The acquired signals are then converted into 
      digital form for further processing. Before A/D conversion a low pass analog filter 
      is used as an antialiasing filter. The cutoff frequency of the filter depends on the 
      type of the signal used. The cutoff frequency of 1 kHz and sampling frequency of 
      2 kHz is sufficient for the armature current signal.<br />
      <br /><strong>3. Signal processing and feature extraction:</strong> There are several algorithms used for processing the digital signal. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Power Spectral Density (PSD), MUltiple SIgnal Classifier (MUSIC), Wavelet decomposition, Wigner-Ville 
      Decomposition (WVD), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), etc. are few such 
      algorithms. In most of the methods, amplitudes at various fault frequencies are 
      extracted from the signal spectrum.<br />
      <br /><strong>4. Pattern matching and decision making:</strong> Simple thresholding to various machine 
      learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), etc. are used to differentiate the faulty motors from the healthy ones.<br />
